#include <iostream> is a pre-processor directive that tells informs the processor-when compliling code- to include additional header files in the program.
#The # is the compiler directive and with #include the preprocessor imports information- additional headers and defined coding terminology- from another file of code.
# iostream is the definition of telling the preprocessor, "Hey, reference these additional #include files to understanf the code I am writing"
# <> in <iostream> and all #include files is the start and end indicator of the file name.
# #include <> can be viewed as a bookmark that references declared variables in which the current file will use to simplify the desired code process.
# The variables declared in reference to the # files would be integerers in the current file. Hence, the code mentioned in slide 1 from the lecture will not work without "cout" (\
which prints the output). )
