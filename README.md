Question_1
Investigate what the line #include <iostream> does. In particular, what command in the program would not be possible if you did not include this line? What reference did you find online to do this?
  
  
Question_2
Modify the ccd' file so that it takes two arguments as input. The first argument should be your name, and the second argument should be your age. Then, in the program, print to the screen these two arguments. What happens if you run your program, which expects two arguments (name, age) with only a single argument, your name?


Question_3
From Project Euler, describe the procedure or algorithm that you would use to solve question 1. “If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.”


--Note that I am not asking you to write a program to do this but rather describe the set of procedures that you would use, the directions that you eventually want to give to the computer.


Question_4 
Write a program that defines and uses a struct which stores the contents necessary to define a four-vector (What is a four vector?), which contains the kinetic information of a particle. In your main function, define two instances of these four vectors. Then, create a third instance which is the sum of the first two four vectors. Calculate the invariant mass of this four vector and print that to the terminal.
